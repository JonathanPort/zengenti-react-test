# Readme
This is a react app contained within a laravel application. I used Laravel as that is what I would normally use for backend functionality and so it was the easiest way for me to get this project running. From this stage it would be very easy to go and build an api for the app within laravel.

I primarily use Vue so I had to adjust to react again as I haven't used it in a while but I found it pretty straight forward minus the redux side of things. Last time I used a store in react it was basically the same as a Vue store which was a single class containing all the getters and setters needed. I attempted to figure how to get redux working but decided to leave it for the sake of time and delivering the main aspect which was building a near pixel perfect page from the design.

I integrated react router which was straightforward and make the top navigation links use the router.

To improve the work I would have made certain aspects work, e.g. it would be nice to have buttons animate, view transitions, accessibility features such as tab indexes, outlines, etc. I'm working full time so I just didn't have enough time to really perfect this page but it still demonstrates my frontend abilities so I'm happy to submit.
